/*
The teacher is really happy with the program you have created so far. But now they want to have an easy way to check if a student has a passing grade. A passing grade is anything that is not an "F".

Complete the function hasPassingGrade that takes a student score as a parameter. Your function should return true if the student has a passing grade and false if they do not.

Tips

Use the getGrade function to get the student's grade. Then check if the grade is passing or not.
*/

function hasPassingGrade(score) {
  const grade = getGrade(score);
  if(grade!=="F"){
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }

}

console.log(hasPassingGrade(100));
console.log(hasPassingGrade(53));
console.log(hasPassingGrade(87));
